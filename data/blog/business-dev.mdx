# Business Development

Business development….Ohh dear this is an amazing expedition finding the unknown and returned back with a humungous wealth of wisdom

At the start of the 3rd phase… A young lad (it’s me :) ) was approached and appointed as a deputy of the business head under an alpha tech-savvy who was the founder of the cub himself. I was very anxious and doubted my caliber to run things well.

But, things are different, I got an amazing opportunity of selecting people among our club for the committee, in return I selected valuable gems (my team ;P).

As the time slowly progressed and building the foundation of the committee, the former chief handed over his entire responsibility to me with a lot of hope.

And, here started the mission… we all focussed on the pieces of stuff about what exactly the crew needed? and came up with different ideas to combat all odds in the club better.

We came up with Business Analysis, Upskills activities, Connection & Collaboration, and more…….

In a line about the above stuff:

### Business Analysis :

Reviewing Business process and developing optimization strategies



### Upskills activities:

To equip ourselves and our fellow engineers with contemporary skills.

 
### Connection & Collaboration:

Collating and gaining contacts with aim of yielding equal benefits.

In raw, we had GD, Debates, Business Discussions, negotiations, and what else we unveiled our new selves?

And all our activities came our these subjects these all that made our journey adventurous and joyful.

These kinda journeys are worthwhile and deserved to be experienced by everybody at their tender age. I'm lucky I had hefty of them.

Dankss :))
