# Open cloud

Do you know where this planet’s cheapest cloud service providing platform was built?

Yeah, obviously it was molded by the hands of the elite engineers here in Pattarai !

I along with my team developed a web app, right from the scratch both the server-side and the software side.

We had roller coaster experience level fun during the learning phase for this project. We as a team learnt the techstack required for this project alongside working hands-on in the project. We gained the crystal clear knowledge on the micro architecture and cloud computing in the vital way by our Veteran and Founder of the club, Mr. Pon Rahul. We didn't shrink our borders only to us for learning, it was open to all to get themselves enlightened with our learnzeit sessions.

Speaking on my experience in this project, I learnt front end web development along with few automation. The team spirit was so high between the team which was reflected during the prototyping and doubt solving sessions. The quick learning habit in the team led to this achieving this zenith of completing the phase 1 of Pattarai’s Open cloud in a few span of months. I, as a member of the project, loved the vibe between us and became close buddies. We had a dream, we designed it, we developed it !
