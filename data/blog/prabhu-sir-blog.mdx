Pattarai as a Launch Pad for Emerging Technologies

I have always thought of Pattarai as a Tech Community making social/societal impacts. We should work more on socially relevant projects which will improve the Quality of Life, I am realistic still we have a long way to go.

We should bring more awareness about the Emerging Technologies like Virtual Reality(VR), Augmented Reality (AR), Robots, Artificial Intelligence (AI), Internet of Things (IoT), Block Chain, Drones and 3D Printing to our Community members.

Tech Talks, Impromptu Discussions,Developer Circles, Hackathons for Social good, Bootcamps will be able to create an ecosystem towards LICETians working towards Emerging Technologies.

I am sure we will spread our wings with New Facility in our campus, The Fab Lab and this will give our community members an opportunity to interact with Technologists, Entrepreneurs, Thought Leaders to build and nurture an Emerging Technologies ecosystem in the campus.

Let's do more and do better!
