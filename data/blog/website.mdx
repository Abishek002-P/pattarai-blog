From the beginning, we had a pretty excellent standard website for PATTARAI. However, as time passes, we evolve.

We have redesigned the website to provide our community a fresh new look. After all, our website is a window to the rest of the world. We were a group of seven developers with experience and knowledge of developing small-scale websites.

However, this was our first advanced-level React JS project. While working on our project, we learnt a lot of intriguing things.To add a sassy touch to our website, we included 3D models and lots of interesting animations.

We structured our color scheme, content, and images to provide an eye-pleasing experience for any visitor to our website. To develop a masterpiece, learning is always put into practice. I'm delighted that my team and I put what we learnt into practice and were able to complete a milestone in our project "Website 2.0." On our website, we've explored a variety of topics. We have a home page where you can keep up with our most recent news. And there's a page about us where you can learn everything you need to know about our community in less than a minute. Pattarai encourages healthy competition, thus we have our own Pattarai's League. We included pages for events that we conducted and projects that we work on. Do you want to work with us??
